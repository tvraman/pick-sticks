* Overview 

This directory contains an implementation of the /Pick Up Sticks/ game
described in my paper [[http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/thinking-of-math/thinking-of-math.html][Thinking Of Mathematics (Section 5)]].

It's an interesting experience writing it in Rust as I learn the
language. The original implementation described in my paper was
written in 1987 in Fortran-77, and consisted of one single
function. Though that style of programming would be frowned upon today
and is clearly not advisable for programming in the large, it's
interesting to observe that a more structured implementation as seen
in this Rust implementation qrequires a lot more fore-thought with
respect to code organization.
